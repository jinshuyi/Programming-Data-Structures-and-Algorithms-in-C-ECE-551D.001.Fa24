# Programming-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-C-ECE-551D.001.Fa24

##Description
This class is intended to get you ready to program in the professional world.   We'll note that while we have the Canvas site to outline what you need to do and when, most things will be done on the Mastery Learning Platform (which you will be introduced to in the first week of class).   If you want to see your grades for formative or evaluative assignments, please run view-grades on the MLP.  Exam grades can be viewed in Gradescope (in the menu on the left).
