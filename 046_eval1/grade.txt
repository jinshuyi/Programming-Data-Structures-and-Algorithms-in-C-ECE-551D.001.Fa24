Code quality was graded by: Xianjing Huang
Please ask them if you have any questions:
------------------------------------------
 * Makes good use of C library functions: Always (>90%)
 * Functions are short: Always (>90%)
 * Step 4 makes good re-use of step 3 code: Always (>90%)
 * Comments explain how things work where appropriate: Always (>90%)
 * Functions have good names: Always (>90%)
 * Variables have good names: Always (>90%)
 * Line lengths are reasonable: Always (>90%)
 * Indentation is proper: Always (>90%)
 * Brace style is consistent: Always (>90%)
Your TA wrote the following comments:
Perfect job! You did a really good abstraction to avoided long functions, and re-use them in different steps! Also, the line lengths of the code are reasonable. Suggestions: Make the comments more concise and avoid long comment lines. Keep going!

For quality, you earned 25 / 25 points
