Code quality was graded by: Kevin Xue
Your TA graded this based on use of C++03
Please ask them if you have any questions:
------------------------------------------
 * Classes are nouns: Always (>90%)
 * Methods are verbs: Often (70-90%)
 * Good Use of Has-A: Often (70-90%)
 * Good Use of IS-A: Often (70-90%)
 * Uses references (avoids needless copies): Often (70-90%)
 * Follows Rule of 3: Always (>90%)
 * Good use of public/private: Always (>90%)
 * const correct: Often (70-90%)
 * Good use of STL (vector, set, map): Always (>90%)
 * Avoids Duplicating Code Between Container and Tanker: Yes
 * Uses subtype polymorphism + dynamic dispatch (as opposed to if-else on type of ship): Yes
 * Step 4: Find fitting ship efficiently: O(lg(N)+K)
 * Find method is generic: Yes
Your TA wrote the following comments:
Nice attempt! You've parsed input and attempted to manage ships and cargoes systematically. However, your code relies more on procedural checks and less on object-oriented design. Consider using polymorphism for different ship types instead of manual type checking. Also, think about using references or smart pointers to avoid unnecessary copying. Improving const correctness, encapsulation, and leveraging OOP features like inheritance and virtual functions will make your code more maintainable and scalable. Keep practicing, and you'll see noticeable improvements.

For quality, you earned 29.5 / 32 points
